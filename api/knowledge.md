# Project Organization Guidelines

[Previous sections remain unchanged...]

## Best Practices

- Verify file existence before operations
- Use explicit paths rather than relative paths
- Keep similar files grouped logically
- Maintain clean root directory structure
- Start with minimal viable endpoints before adding features
- Focus on core API functionality first, UI/dashboard second
- Test each endpoint thoroughly before adding new ones
- Prioritize production deployment testing over fixing local development warnings
  - Local Node.js version mismatches may not affect Vercel deployment
  - Test on Vercel before spending time on local environment issues
  - Development-only warnings can be addressed after confirming production stability
