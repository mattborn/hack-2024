create a vanilla HTML project in /linktink with index.html, scripts.js, and styles.css that allows you to paste a link that is instantly identified (based on JSON file with domains and canned rules that might use regex or a segment index based system) and shortened with every query parameter displayed as either an input or dropdown (may depend on the domain specific rules from the JSON file) and that pasted link is instantly copied back to my clipboard with the adjustments based on the rules and as I make changes from the dropdowns those are also put back in my clipboard, craft a couple examples in the JSON (e.g. for spotify and youtube remove si share id, for amazon remove everything but the unique SKU, for Figma show dropdowns for each query parameter, etc.), craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible

first test was a success! i want the rules.js to be a json file so reformat and update the scripts, we need to provide more feedback to the user by moving the copied link out of the input showing in a list directly below with a checkmark if the copy to clipboard was successful and perhaps you can click to copy those items again and persist the list with localstorage
