## What is commitzero about?

Peace is the net inverse of unrest.

Being a high commitment person is good.

Drowning in obligation is bad.

Ownership is good.

Owing in perpetuity is bad.

Itâ€™s like being in debt with your time.

And you are the kind of person who genuinely wants to commit to that maximum one person can sustain whilst alive.

Commit zero is about closing that loop.

How?

Organize deletion.
An everlong not-to-do list.

Visual delegation.
Automate to machines.
Outsource to humans.

Conscious deferment.

Lifestyle design.

Authentic doing.

This product answers the question of distance to goal.

No idea how I will pull this off.

Start, fail (fall short), share, repeat.

## TODO?

- [ ] Tracking commitments?
- [ ] Half life on decision to delegate, defer, dismiss?
- [ ] Delete as closing tabs?
- [ ] Canonical data on started projects?
