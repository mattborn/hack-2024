create a vanilla HTML project in /burn with index.html, scripts.js, and styles.css that contains inputs that allows me to add rows for something like hourly rate, # hours, and billable=true that generates a mini dashboard that live updates as I make edits showing the total billable, total non-billable, and net total, craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible
