Just like it sounds.

## Fundamental principle

The file system is step one when trying to make a video. You have to have the content you plan to stitch together. Many times what’s hard about keeping track of how close to done you are with the video is knowing if you’ve included everything and that it’s all in one place. A tool that uses the file system as a source of truth for managing that video as a project is something we’ve never seen.

## First demo

Iterate on a file system analyzer that generates a JSON file that powers a dashboard with stats and statuses for each project.

## External data

Also need an increasingly efficient, repeatable process for getting videos from external sources like Apple Photos, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

For now, we go month by month and organize into project folders that get backed up across thumb drive, NAS, and someday cloud storage.

## Automation hypotheses

- Tracking progress month to month
- Date based file organization
- Location based file organization
- Distinguish between short (5 seconds) and long videos
