create a vanilla HTML project in /arrowstate with index.html, scripts.js, and styles.css that allows me to use arrow keys to step through a list of objects that hydrate the page where one of the keys maps to an html selector on half the page that gets displayed alongside the JSON renderer (reference /bornjson), seed a simple example.json file, craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible
