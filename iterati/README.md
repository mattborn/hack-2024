# Iterati

A new way to build software and manage data.

## Research

We all have limited time and brainpower (or ability to think).

And yet, there are patterns in language that unite us all. See: [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

What if we could use patterns to build software?

And what if that software could generate valuable materials for the real world?

Iterati is our attempt to explore that idea.

We treat the ability to build custom, personalized software as fundamental to computing in the age of AI.

And we want to give everyone this superpower.

Not just PMs, Shane. ;)

## Experience

1. Rapid encoding of canonical data since LLMs are bad at it.
2. Rapid enrichment of canonical data since LLMs are good at it.
3. Rapid review of transformations since humans are better at it.

Every step is tricky.

1. Encoding is tricky b/c the software will be slightly different in every use case.
2. Enrichment is tricky b/c again hard to keep the base prompts generic.
3. Review is tricky for the same reason, e.g. if there is location data then a map is required for an effective review.

For these reasons, we simultaneously emphasize the purpose built software is imperative and also that it may be impossible to build a general purpose tool for iteration.

### New idea, and also the original

Perhaps it should start with a textarea that accepts comma-delimited entity names.

And from there all enrichment, review, and versioning happen within the interface.

But now we need a remote JSON DB.
