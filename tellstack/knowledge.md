# Project Goals
- Create a simple audio recorder with real-time waveform visualization
- Use WaveSurfer.js for visualization - this is a core requirement, not optional

# Technical Notes
- WaveSurfer.js should be used for its intended purpose (visualization) rather than worked around
- Keep solutions minimal and focused on core requirements
- Preserve existing code and behavior when making changes
