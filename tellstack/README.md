# Tellstack

A reusable starter kit for tell-style apps.

## Research

### Vision (philosophy)

Do you believe in line-by-line editing?

Or thought-by-thought?

Or moment-by-moment?

This is what tell-style apps are all about.

Our development experiences should reflect what our minds are doing instead of what machines are expecting.

Why is development limited to those who know how to code?

And no, this is not another no code or low code trick.

### Theory

Until we have AGI, multiple record actions are better than one.

These patterns are universal because they mirror existing machine patterns. (e.g. CRUD, ORM, CRAP)

## Experience

### Modality

Frames vs. layers vs. pages vs. versions?

1. Record & Transcribe (create, retrieve)
2. New Session (per deliverable, create)
3. Edit deliverable (update)
4. Redo deliverable (update)
5. Change deliverable, data (to a completely different type)
6. Change deliverable, display (to a completely different layout)
7. Delete deliverable (destroy, must be manual!)

### One Liner

Itâ€™s all about the one liner, baby!
