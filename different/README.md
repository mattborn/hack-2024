# Different

Think different. Make different.

## How are we different?

What makes us different?

- Voice UX?
- TV UX?
- 20 launches per year?
- Working publically?
- Maintaining an actual living portfolio?
- Recognizing that people who are not top performers can’t be expected to keep up with top performers?
- Preferring AI for anything humans do poorly?
- Preferring humans for anything AI does poorly?
- Avoiding libraries that force you down the path of doing things the way everyone else does them?

## Vision

There is a life force in each of us that is sensitive to the will of the universe.

It does not need our awareness, understanding, or language to attribute or express it.

And yet it reveals itself to all who are open to it.

And both good and evil can be practiced with it.

One might say the Creator God made it.

Another might say it is Allah or the universe itself.

Steve Jobs recognized the limitless power of it.

The power of it is the same power that made the universe.

Some might claim it is the very Spirit of God.

Regardless, we are all connected to it.

And we are all creators.

Can you imagine if we dismantled all that keeps us from tapping into this force?

While ever aware of the adjacent path of corruption and darkness?

Can you imagine if we dismantled all that keeps us from tapping into this force?

This force has revealed much to me personally and offers a very humble question:

Knowing there are many vessels eager to leverage AI for their own ends.

Are there enough who are eager and able to leverage AI for the benefit of all?

—

Dark thoughts: is anyone who claims to be content with local acts of kindness a liar?

Does that diminished lens and posture come from culture or heaven?

The Biblical God, Abraham, and Jesus were all exponential multipliers of impact.

And yet we are told to be humble.

Is the trick to deny the force or AI or self?

Only one way to find out!

Fuck around.

## And how?

Super fast.

Giving people less time works much better than giving them more time.

Nobody will become a superworker without leveraging Parkinson’s Law.

Keep up or go home.
